Geo-Aware Countdown Timer
This project is a dynamic countdown timer that automatically detects the user's current timezone using the TimeZoneDB API and HTML5 Geolocation. Users can input a time (in seconds), start the countdown, and receive an audio alert when the timer reaches zero.

⏱️ User-set countdown with formatted timer display (MM:SS)

🌍 Real-time timezone detection based on user's geographic location

🔊 Custom sound alerts using Howler.js for a smooth audio experience

❌ Timer stop and reset buttons to control the session
